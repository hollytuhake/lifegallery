# lifegallery

This weekend's application will be a gallery of 6 or more pictures of significance to you. When someone clicks on a picture, they should see a brief synopsis of why you chose to display that photo. Users can also heart/thumbs up/favorite your photo as many times as they want; you'll need to keep track of how many times it was clicked.

When you're done, host this on Heroku!

#Technologies

Node/Express - to serve your files
Angular - client-side logic
CSS - flex your style muscles
Heroku - to make your site available to the world

#Hints

Explore built-in Angular functionality like ng-click, ng-src, ng-show, ng-hide, ng-if.
Use arrays and objects to store your data.

#Hard Mode

Add Bootstrap to style your gallery and make it responsive.
Include a view counter to keep track of how many times a specific image was clicked on.

#Pro Mode

Create a form that will take comments for each of your photos. Display the comments when a "Show Comments" button is clicked.
Create routes to GET and POST new images, comments, view count and likes. You'll need to use $http for this.
